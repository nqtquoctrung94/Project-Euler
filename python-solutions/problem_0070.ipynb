    "## Totient Permutation\n",
    "Euler's totient function, $\\phi(n)$ [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$. For example, as $1, 2, 4, 5, 7$, and $8$, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, $\\phi(9)=6$.The number $1$ is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so $\\phi(1)=1$. <br>\n",
    "Interestingly, $\\phi(87109)=79180$, and it can be seen that $87109$ is a permutation of $79180$.<br>\n",
